## **Description**
For this assignment we were asked to create an employee tracker that allows you to add, view, and update Departments, Roles, and Employees to a database. 
## **Elements**
Database:
To create the app the first thing we needed was to create a database in mySQL. The database needed to include 3 tables. One for departments, one for roles, and one for employees.

Javascript:
Once the database was created we next had to connect to the database and build the code that would prompt the questions for the user.
